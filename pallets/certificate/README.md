# Fennel Certificate Pallet

Fennel Protocol's runtime module for making point-to-point claims as signed certificates.

Fennel's concept of a certificate is just a signal from one account to another. This isn't an action implying trust - this is entirely just a verification of the existence of an identity in the context of an application.

## Send Certificate

Issues a storage action creating a certificate connection between two accounts.

## Revoke Certificate

Eliminates an existing certificate.
